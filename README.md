Discord bot for stock information

This bot can be used to add a discord bot that tracks simple stock information to any discord channel.

Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications to create your bot, make sure to give it administrator permissions.

Replace "TOKEN" with the string of your own bot token.

I host my bot on https://client.pylexnodes.net/, which I followed the instructions of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzA_jvE9Rzo switching Node.js tutorial for Python, everything else is the same.
